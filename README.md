````
(01) [{} â€“> nil] no code => return nil

(02) [nil->constant] nil => simple constant

(03) [constant->constant+] simple constant => complex constant

(04) [constant->scalar] complex constant => variable or an argument

(05) [statement->statements] adding more unconditional statements.

(06) [unconditional->if] splitting the execution path

(07) [scalar->array]

(08) [array->container]

(09) [statement->recursion]

(10) [if->while]

(11) [expression->function] replacing an expression with a function or algorithm

(12) [variable->assignment] replacing the value of a variable.
